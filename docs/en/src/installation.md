# Installation

## Graphical Installer (GUI only, no CLI)

If you only need the graphical application and do not need the command line, download the ready-made installer from the releases page:

**[https://github.com/andgineer/ibkr-porez-rs/releases](https://github.com/andgineer/ibkr-porez-rs/releases)**

### macOS

Download the latest `.dmg` file.
Because the app is not signed with an Apple certificate, macOS may block it on first open.

> _"IBKR Porez" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin._

**Do not move it to the Bin.** Instead:

1. Open **System Settings -> Privacy & Security**
2. At the bottom of the Security section, you will see a blocked-app message. Click **Open Anyway**
3. Confirm opening in the next dialog

You may need to repeat the same steps **twice**:
- first when opening the downloaded installer (`.dmg`)
- and again when launching the installed app from `/Applications` for the first time

After that, the app should launch without warnings.

### Windows

Download the latest `.msi` file.
Because the installer is not code-signed, Windows may show security warnings.

If your browser blocks the download (for example in Microsoft Edge):
1. Open the browser downloads panel (`Ctrl+J`)
2. Find the blocked `.msi` download
3. Click **Keep** -> **Show more** -> **Keep anyway**

When launching the installer, Windows may show **Windows protected your PC**:
1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

You may also see a User Account Control dialog with **Unknown publisher**.
If the file came from the official releases page, click **Yes** to continue.

After installation, the app should start normally.
